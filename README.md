# Decision Structures and Boolean Logic#2

## Nested Decision Structures and the if-elif-else Statement
* Check first condition, and if it is true, check second condition 
* if-elif-else statement: special version of a decision structure

#### Rules for writing nested if statements:
* else clause should align with matching if clause
* statements in each block must be consistently indented

### Relational operator: expression tested by if statement to determine if it is true or false
* ==, >, < , >=, <=, != 

### Logical operators: operators that can be used to create complex Boolean expressions
* and, or, not
* and operator and or operator: binary operators, connect two Boolean expressions into a compound Boolean expression
* not operator: unary operator, reverses the truth of its Boolean operand

#### Short circuit evaluation: deciding the value of a compound Boolean expression after evaluating only one sub expression
* Performed by the or and and operators
  - For or operator: If left operand is true, compound expression is true. Otherwise, evaluate right operand
  - For and operator: If left operand is false, compound expression is false. Otherwise, evaluate right opera
  
##### Boolean variable: references one of two values, True or False, Represented by bool data type
##### Flag: variable that signals when some condition exists in a program

## Decision Structures and Boolean Logic
### Decision structures, including:
* Single alternative decision structures: provides only one alternative path of execution
  - If condition is not true, exit the structure
* Dual alternative decision structures: two possible paths of execution
  - One is taken if the condition is true, and the other if the condition is false
* Nested decision structures: a decision structure can be nested inside another decision structure
### Relational operators and logical operators as used in creating Boolean expressions
### String comparison as used in creating Boolean expressions
### Boolean variables
